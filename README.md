# Hey, welcome 👋

I'm Stacey, a beginner programmer based in **Amsterdam, The Netherlands** 🇳🇱.  
Right now, I’m learning **Python** (with **SQL** up next) as I move from cybersecurity into the world of **data analytics**.  

---

## 🌱 Learning Journey
- Practicing Python basics & data analysis libraries  
- Exploring SQL for working with databases  
- Starting to sketch out ideas for my first projects  

---

## 🔐 Background
I come from a **cybersecurity** background, but my curiosity for data and problem-solving pushed me toward analytics.  
Here I’ll be documenting that switch by sharing code, experiments, and projects.  

---

## 🎮 Outside the Code
When I’m not learning or coding, you’ll probably find me:  
- Gaming  
- Shooting film photography or practising my videography skills 
- Watching or playing American football
